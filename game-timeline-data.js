Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\n\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \"quick time events\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\n\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them.\n\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch.

The two games are very similar, as both revolve around troopers from various factions fighting in different locales. Battlefront II, however, includes elements and missions from Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, as well as enhanced aspects of gameplay including space combat and the ability to play as Jedi characters or other heroes.\nThe game's campaign mode is entitled Rise of the Empire. The story takes the player on different missions throughout the galaxy as part of the Galactic Empire's 501st Legion known as Vader's Fist.\nOther game modes include \"Instant Action\" where the player can fight on any battleground, land or space, and \"Galactic Conquest\" where the player fights as a certain faction for control of the galaxy.\nThe game was released on November 1, 2005, for the PC, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2, the same day that Revenge of the Sith was released on DVD.\n\nSource: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Battlefront_II", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii", "rating": 75.6, "developers": [63, 64], "cloudHash": "uyqccqy6nirfgcyrynwk", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uyqccqy6nirfgcyrynwk.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/uyqccqy6nirfgcyrynwk.jpg"}]}, {"airtableId": "recfnOgm2JEZ4mixW", "title": "Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith", "support": ["PS2"], "genre": "", "date": "", "completed": true, "igdbId": 6159, "slug": "star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith", "igdbName": "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith", "summary": "Third-person action/adventure game, Star Wars: Episode III, delivers the ultimate Jedi action experience as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi join forces in fierce battles and heroic lightsaber duels until one's lust for power and the other's devotion to duty leads to a final confrontation between good and evil.\n\nIn Star Wars: Episode III, players control all the Jedi abilities of both Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, including devastating Force powers and advanced lightsaber techniques involving robust combo attacks and defensive maneuvers.

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3.
