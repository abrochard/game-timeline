Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).", "completed": true, "support": ["PS3"], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war", "title": "God of War", "cloudHash": "qek7zg34huu8kk7p1sjg", "igdbName": "God of War", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qek7zg34huu8kk7p1sjg.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/qek7zg34huu8kk7p1sjg.jpg"}], "genre": ["Beat'em Up"]}, {"developers": [4357], "date": "", "rating": 92.0, "airtableId": "reccpjslaFYT1nHJ4", "slug": "god-of-war-ii", "igdbId": 551, "summary": "", "completed": true, "support": ["PS3"], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ii", "title": "God of War 2", "cloudHash": "exvgdlmehl8ptnjyznuk", "igdbName": "God of War II", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/exvgdlmehl8ptnjyznuk.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/exvgdlmehl8ptnjyznuk.jpg"}], "genre": ["Beat'em Up"]}, {"developers": [4357], "date": "", "rating": 96.1428571428571, "airtableId": "rec4HrWh1y2ncKbPD", "slug": "god-of-war-iii", "igdbId": 499, "summary": "", "completed": true, "support": ["PS3"], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-iii", "title": "God of War 3", "cloudHash": "g8n5eufyfqgkvfqfxxsx", "igdbName": "God of War III", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/g8n5eufyfqgkvfqfxxsx.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/g8n5eufyfqgkvfqfxxsx.jpg"}], "genre": ["Beat'em Up"]}, {"developers": [431, 4357], "date": "", "rating": 85.0, "airtableId": "rec4qSdO1Nl6ekdwy", "slug": "god-of-war-chains-of-olympus", "igdbId": 552, "summary": "", "completed": true, "support": ["PS3"], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus", "title": "God of War Chains of Olympus", "cloudHash": "dgcfancolie0xnynwlzv", "igdbName": "God of War: Chains of Olympus", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dgcfancolie0xnynwlzv.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/dgcfancolie0xnynwlzv.jpg"}], "genre": ["Beat'em Up"]}, {"developers": [431, 4357], "date": "", "rating": 89.6666666666667, "airtableId": "recyQCPRLiK1ruAfS", "slug": "god-of-war-ghost-of-sparta", "igdbId": 550, "summary": "", "completed": true, "support": ["PSP"], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ghost-of-sparta", "title": "God of War Ghost of Sparta", "cloudHash": "lvmsawd75v2g79ur0t2r", "igdbName": "God of War: Ghost of Sparta", "coverURL": [{"size": "cover_big", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lvmsawd75v2g79ur0t2r.jpg"}, {"size": "cover_small", "url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/lvmsawd75v2g79ur0t2r.jpg"}], "genre": ["Beat'em Up"]}, {"developers": [365, 306], "date": "2016-02-28", "rating": 87.1428571428571, "airtableId": "recoTywyRckxKlGnv", "slug": "grand-theft-auto-iv", "igdbId": 731, "summary": "What does the American dream mean today?

The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \"Heavenly Sword\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\n\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \"quick time events\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\n\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them.\n\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch.

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3.

The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience.
