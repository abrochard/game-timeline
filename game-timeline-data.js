Created by Double Fine's lead animator, Tasha Harris, the game follows the adventure of a group of young friends who must rid their neighborhood of monsters using only their wits, their bravery, and their home-made costumes. Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode-where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes-to-life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloweens worst monsters.", "coverURL": [{"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rs2nivvwq0amgmuw929c.jpg", "size": "cover_big"}, {"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/rs2nivvwq0amgmuw929c.jpg", "size": "cover_small"}], "airtableId": "recSdtNYGV1BR87OK", "igdbName": "Costume Quest", "genre": "", "date": "2014-06-29", "developers": [85], "completed": "", "igdbId": 5637}, {"rating": 63.375, "slug": "counterspy", "cloudHash": "rnvb2uygqmyxo4yifoeb", "title": "CounterSpy", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/counterspy", "support": ["PS3"], "summary": "", "coverURL": [{"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rnvb2uygqmyxo4yifoeb.jpg", "size": "cover_big"}, {"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/rnvb2uygqmyxo4yifoeb.jpg", "size": "cover_small"}], "airtableId": "recpnmTQ0COzRw9cW", "igdbName": "CounterSpy", "genre": ["Stealth"], "date": "2016-07-20", "developers": [5985], "completed": true, "igdbId": 7612}, {"rating": "", "slug": "crash-bandicoot-warped", "cloudHash": "b0yse08hwfkbmn9bedxd", "title": "Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crash-bandicoot-warped", "support": ["PS1"], "summary": "Oh, yeah!

The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \"Heavenly Sword\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\n\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \"quick time events\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\n\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them.\n\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989. \n \nThe Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards. \n \nThe game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010).

The game is set in the distant future, where space transportation is common. Space trains carry passengers and goods all across space. A particular space train, however, had some very special cargo. Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe big feature of our game is the randomized elements. The position you spawn on the map, which map you spawn on, the location of chests, enemy spawns, item spawns and more are all randomly chosen by the AI Director! We also have a massive amount of content in our game: we have 100 unique items planned, all with interesting effects. No +HP or +DAMAGE, but chance to spawn missiles and stop time. You have the option of choosing between 10 characters, all with their own different moveset.\r\r\n\r\r\nAnother thing that\u2019s important in our game is that as time increases, so does difficulty. Represented in a bar on the HUD, every minute increases the enemies\u2019 power and spawn count, developing a great sense of urgency.", "coverURL": [{"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/okhrs0w7ilzxsychwdig.jpg", "size": "cover_big"}, {"url": "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_small/okhrs0w7ilzxsychwdig.jpg", "size": "cover_small"}], "airtableId": "rec9gQdJAZA8833eL", "igdbName": "Risk of Rain", "genre": ["Roguelike"], "date": "2016-05-07", "developers": [1532], "completed": true, "igdbId": 3173}, {"rating": 89.0, "slug": "rocket-league", "cloudHash": "edkpgyqgfsxyiby9pyj5", "title": "Rocket League", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rocket-league", "support": ["PC"], "summary": "Soccer meets racing once again in our long-awaited, MP-focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars! \n \nA futuristic Sports-Action game, Rocket League, equips players with booster-rigged vehicles that can be crashed into balls for incredible goals or epic saves across multiple, highly-detailed arenas.

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3.
